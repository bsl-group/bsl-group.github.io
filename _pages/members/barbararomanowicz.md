# Prof. Barbara Romanowicz

## Research Description
Barbara Romanowicz received her undergraduate degree from Ecole Normale Supérieure, "Sèvres" in Paris, France in 1974, her Maîtrise de Mathématiques Pures from the Université Paris 6 in 1972, her Agrégation de Mathématiques in Paris, France in 1973, her M.S. in Applied Physics at Harvard University in 1975, her Doctorat de 3e cycle in Astronomy, at the Université Paris 6, also in 1975, and her Doctorat d'Etat, Spécialité Géophysique at the Université Paris 7 in 1979.

Her current research involves deep earth structure and dynamics using elastic and inelastic seismic tomography, waveform modelling of mantle and core phases, wave propagation in complex heterogeneous and anisotropic media, and earth's normal modes and surface waves. She is also interested in earthquake processes and scaling laws, real time estimation of earthquake parameters, development of modern broadband seismic and geophysical observatories on land and in the oceans, and general planetary seismology.
