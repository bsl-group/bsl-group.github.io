<strong>Undergraduate Researcher</strong>

I am a current undergraduate senior pursuing a double major in geophysics and astrophysics at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on measuring azimuthal anisotropy in the southwest Pacific using both source-side and station-side measurements, integrating observational and theoretical seismology. The results of this work will serve as constraints for the full-waveform tomography of the southwest Pacific, which is being developed within the Global Seismology Research Group.

As I approach graduation, I am actively seeking opportunities to advance my expertise, either through graduate programs or full-time employment. I am particularly interested in applying my skills to better understand the interior structure of the Earth and other terrestrial planets, with the goal of contributing to our knowledge of planetary structure and evolution.
