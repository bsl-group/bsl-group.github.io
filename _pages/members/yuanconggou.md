#### Leveraging Submarine DAS Arrays for Offshore Earthquake Early Warning: A Case Study in Monterey Bay, California (Gou et al, 2025, BSSA)

Detecting offshore earthquakes in real time is challenging for traditional land-based seismic networks due to insufficient station coverage. Application of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) to submarine cables has the potential to extend the reach of seismic networks and thereby improve real-time earthquake detection and earthquake early warning (EEW).
