<strong>Earthling</strong>

I am currently a PhD student at Berkeley Seismology Lab (BSL) of UC Berkeley. I work with Prof. Richard Allen on incorporating DAS (Distributed Acoustic Sensing) sensors into the existing earthquake early warning system in California. From the proof-of-concept algorithm design to real-time implementation and optimaztion, I work with many researchers at BSL to enhance the monitoring ability of our seismic network. 

I am also interested in the fluidâ€“solid earth interaction. For example, utlizing energy from ocean microseisms to image shallow offshore fault structures; Observing and modeling the atmosphere-solid earth coupled system in terms of normal modes of the Earth.

#### Leveraging Submarine DAS Arrays for Offshore Earthquake Early Warning: A Case Study in Monterey Bay, California (Gou et al, 2025, BSSA)

Detecting offshore earthquakes in real time is challenging for traditional land-based seismic networks due to insufficient station coverage. Application of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) to submarine cables has the potential to extend the reach of seismic networks and thereby improve real-time earthquake detection and earthquake early warning (EEW).

#### SeaFOAM : A year-long das deployment in Monterey bay, California (Romanowicz et al, 2023, SRL)

Seafloor Fiber-Optic Array in Monterey Bay (SeaFOAM) is a permanent offshore DAS deployment in Monterey Bay, California, with the purpose of seismic monitoring and beyond. We apply DAS to a 52-km long submarine cable maintained by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), starting from August 2022. We have explored the dataset for seismic and ocean waves, subsurface structure, and relative instrument response.
