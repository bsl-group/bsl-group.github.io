I am currently a PhD student at Berkeley Seismology Lab (BSL) of UC Berkeley.


#### Leveraging Submarine DAS Arrays for Offshore Earthquake Early Warning: A Case Study in Monterey Bay, California (Gou et al, 2025, BSSA)

Detecting offshore earthquakes in real time is challenging for traditional land-based seismic networks due to insufficient station coverage. Application of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) to submarine cables has the potential to extend the reach of seismic networks and thereby improve real-time earthquake detection and earthquake early warning (EEW).

#### SeaFOAM : A year-long das deployment in Monterey bay, California (Romanowicz et al, 2023, SRL)

Seafloor Fiber-Optic Array in Monterey Bay (SeaFOAM) is a permanent offshore DAS deployment in Monterey Bay, California, with the purpose of seismic monitoring and beyond. We apply DAS to a 52-km long submarine cable maintained by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), starting from August 2022. We have explored the dataset for seismic and ocean waves, subsurface structure, and relative instrument response.
