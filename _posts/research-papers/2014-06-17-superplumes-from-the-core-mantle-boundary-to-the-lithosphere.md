## Abstract 
Three-dimensional modeling of upper-mantle anelastic structure reveals that
thermal upwellings associated with the two superplumes, imaged by seismic
elastic tomography at the base of the mantle, persist through the upper-mantle
transition zone and are deflected horizontally beneath the lithosphere. This
explains the unique transverse shear wave isotropy in the central Pacific. We
infer that the two superplumes may play a major and stable role in supplying
heat and horizontal flow to the low-viscosity asthenospheric channel, lubricating plate motions and feeding hot spots. We suggest that more heat maybe carried through the core-mantle boundary than is accounted for by hot spot
fluxes alone.
