## Abstract

How cratons—extremely stable continental areas of the Earth’s crust—formed and remained largely unchanged for more than 2,500 million years is much debated. Recent studies of seismic-wave receiver function data have detected a structural boundary under continental cratons at depths too shallow to be consistent with the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary, as inferred from seismic tomography and other geophysical studies. Here we show that changes in the direction of azimuthal anisotropy with depth reveal the presence of two distinct lithospheric layers throughout the stable part of the North American continent. The top layer is thick (,150 km) under the Archaean core and tapers out on the surrounding Palaeozoic borders. Its thickness variations follow those of a highly depleted layer inferred from thermo-barometric analysis of xenoliths. The lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary is relatively flat (ranging from 180 to 240 km in depth), in agreement with the presence of a thermal conductive root that subsequently formed around the depleted chemical layer. Our findings tie together seismological, geochemical and geodynamical studies of the cratonic lithosphere in North America. They also suggest that the horizon detected in receiver function studies probably corresponds to the sharp mid-lithospheric boundary rather than to the more gradual lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary.

<figcaption><strong>Fig. 1.</strong> (<strong>A</strong>) Left: Precambrian basement age in the North American continent and seismic depth profiles at selected locations. a, Precambrian basement age (after ref. 23). The white triangles are the seismic stations used in b, and the blue lines are the locations of profiles AA9, BB9 and CC9, discussed in the text. Petrologic sample locations are from ref. 13. The thick dashed black line shows the approximate boundary of the stable parts of the continent, bounded by the Laramide deformation/Rocky Mountain front from the west, and the Ouachita and Appalachian fronts from the south and east1. The thick dashed grey lines indicate crustal shear zones1. GSL, the Great Slave Lake shear zone; GFT, the Great Falls tectonic zone; TH, the Trans-Hudson orogen; CB, the Cheyenne belt; NQO and Torngat, shear zones related to the New Quebec orogen and the Torngat orogen, respectively. Blue two-letter labels are Xenocryst sample site names. Right: Upper-mantle layering defined by changes in the direction of the fast axis of azimuthal anisotropy. Depth cross-sections across the three profiles—AA9 (a), BB9 (b) and CC9 (c)—shown in Fig. 1a. The direction of the fast axis is colour-coded as a deviation from the North American APM (see scale)26. The thick dashed line is our inferred LAB. a, Yava/Mazat/G, the Proterozoic Yavapai, Mazatzal and Grenville provinces; McR, the mid-continental rift. b, The profile is truncated to the west at the Rocky Mountain front, where the lithospheric character changes abruptly. NQO, Proterozoic New Quebec orogen. c, This profile follows the sites where xenocryst samples have been obtained13. Sample sites are labelled (two-letter abbreviations) at the bottom of the plot as in Fig. 1. The boundary corresponding to Mg#93 (ref. 13) is indicated by a grey line, and the black line corresponds to Mg#92.</figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Fig. 2.</strong> (<strong>A</strong>) Cartoon illustrating the inferred stratification of the lithosphere. Beneath the craton, three layers of anisotropy are present: two in the lithosphere (layers 1 and 2), and one in the asthenosphere. Layer 1 corresponds to the chemically distinct, depleted Archaean lithosphere, and layer 2 is the thermal root, separated from the asthenosphere by the LAB, which is at relatively constant depth beneath the stable part of the continent, but rapidly shallows between the tectonic part of the continent (in the western USA) and in the oceans. The boundary between layers 1 and 2 is seismically sharp but its fine-scale structure is likely to be complex. The depth extent of the zone of present-day flow-related anisotropy is not tightly constrained by our study. This figure was modified from ref. 3.</figcaption>
