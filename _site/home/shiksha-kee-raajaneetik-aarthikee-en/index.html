<p>To run the system efficiently the state relies on tools like administration, army, tax systems, industries etc. Education is also one such tool. The product of education is utilised to speed up the areas like offices, researches, business, industries etc. Since the product of education is used by the state, hence the education is also controlled by the state.</p>

<p>Whether the education always has been under control of the state? No.</p>

<p>Long before the emergence of the state, humans existed without state. The education came into existence with humans. It required to know, understand and behave properly in harmony with the gigantic spread of nature and simplifying the struggle for life. To communicate and express the feelings, the standard of phonetic system developed and transferred subsequently to next generations. Similarly, it was learnt that by sharpening the weapons of hunt the ability to kill is enhanced, discovery of fire, skins and barks for keeping body warm, knowledge about the vegetations and their uses etc. The process of learning went up from ancestors and self-experience. These all learning, experiences, discoveries were the education. The format was not documented as book format of these days neither it had the fixed curriculum hence hesitation is there in accepting this concept of earliest education. If we agree that the education means learning then the primitive form of education is like that only. If we try to understand the content and process of the primitive education then it was to serve the needs of individuals as well as the communities. For several thousand years the lessons and contents remained unchanged. It means that basically the education has been the tool for catering the needs of individual and the society, it is characteristics of education.</p>

<p>In the initial and medieval stages of the state establishment, the education was not governed by the state. Till the beginning of British Raj, the education was guided by the social concerns. There were no such subjects and lessons as it is in the schools and colleges today. The children of farmers learnt the agricultural practices from parents and practiced the same. In the same way priesthood, iron smithy, cloth dying, weaponry etc. were the different subjects needed for getting employed in the family trade. There were no such formal institution and curriculum. The family and society used to be the institution to impart trade skills and ethical-moral-cultural knowledges. Trade skills, morality and cultural education was the need of those days. There was no such need of extensive paper-oriented education so it was not popular. The need of workforce for statesmanship and religious works was required in limited numbers that is why there has been a few state-patronised education centres. Means that in the beginning of British Raj the education was free from state control and related with the social concerns.</p>

<p>Instead of high advocacy of the slogan – ‘Education for education’ the reality is its utility in practice. Gained knowledge and acquired skills is mostly used in getting gainful job. From very beginning this is characteristics of education.</p>

<p>Earlier the education was free from state control and related to social concerns but it is different now. Now the education is under state control not under the society. The state now controls and decides schools, teachers, subject content, lessons etc. What can be the reason?</p>

<p>The answer lies in the process of production and state’s requirements. In ancient and medieval periods process of production was not formal. The production used to be carried out by individuals, families or small groups quite informally. So, the formal system of education was not needed. The scale of work in offices and production was very small during the ancient and medieval periods. Religious texts, weaponry, agriculture and commerce were the source of livelihood. The scale of all these activities were small. The number of state officials was countable few. For few offices, simple trades and commerce and the needs of state were fulfilled by one or two education centers. Other skill-based production was also limited. There has not been any explosion for the operational scale in production of weapons, building constructions, work offices, trade and commerce, production of artifacts etc. A person to work in these areas did not need to get formally trained in the job. Unlike today these areas did not have complexities. The skilled artisans were trained within own family and their ability and capacity became known by personal contacts. This means that for the informal production process did not require certification from education system at the same time for a small number of educated persons requirement there was no any concept and need of broadening the scale of education.</p>

<p>With the advent of Britishers, the process of production gradually became formalised with the spread in employment opportunities. Gradually there has been opening of factories, offices and spread in judiciaries and the need of work force on large scale for systematically carrying out tasks was realised. The large-scale demand of the workforce was not possible from the informal system of education or from known personal contacts of able artisans trained within own family framework. It required opening of formal schools to cater the needs of factories, industries and offices in large number. In mid of nineteenth century the spread of education begun with the spread of the industrialisation on modern lines. Madras Medical College in 1835, Thomson College (now IIT Roorkee) in 1847, Ferguson College, Puna in 1870, Aligarh Muslim University in 1875, Dayanand Anglo Vedic College, Lahore in 1886, Central Hindu College, Kashi in 1898 etc. were opened. During this period the ‘India Education Commission’ was constituted under chairmanship of Sir William Wilson Hunter. We can say that with increase in the requirements for trained man power in industries and offices the opportunity of developing the education and training was also developed.</p>

<p>How quick was the response to meet the increased demand for trained manpower can be understood by the figure that in 1855 there were 2810 primary and 281 high schools but in 1871 there were 16473 primary schools and 3070 high schools. In 1855 the number of students in primary schools was 96,923 and in high schools it was 33,801 these numbers respectively were 607,320 and 204,294 in 1871.</p>

<p>It was not only restricted to opening of educational institutions on a larger scale but the educational institutions were moulded to meet requirements of offices and industries during this period. It was not possible to run industries on the lines of old cottage industries. Several hundred workers required to work in team with harmony. Training for harmonization with each other in groups required formal system of schooling like today. Time discipline was imposed in offices and factories. The schools were strictly imposing the norms of regularity and time discipline by fixing daily joining and leaving time of school. It was most essential requirement for workers in the offices and factories to remain disciplined and obedient. The structuring of schools-colleges and lessons were organised in the way that the products from these institutions were disciplined, obedient and good subordinates. Say, joining and leaving schools at fixed time, observing special respect for teachers, completing home works and tasks on time, accepting punishment on not completing tasks, accepting the teacher’s decision of becoming successful or not successful. It was part of training for producing good subordinates. Hence, schools were introduced.</p>

<p>The curriculum was structured around the needs of offices and factories. The offices needed literates who can read, write summary, draft letters, make notes in document files etc. The curriculum included these skills. Only those subjects were taught which was useful for a good worker. Till this day also the subjects that can be used in personal life, away from offices and factories are not included in syllabus. For example, the necessity of remedy in problems related to health like headache, fever, stomach ailments were not given any space. History of country and world was introduced but necessity for looking at the history of village was not necessary as the offices had no any concerns for village history. Other subjects also had the same approach. Only those subjects were taught to students which was required for office works. Technical and vocational skills were limited to requirement industries and business. It means that the syllabus of technical education was also structured in the way that could produce good technical subordinates and mangers.</p>

<p>Policies are the hypothetical ideas of sovereign that shows the pathway for the system to move along. It has the role of guiding the system.</p>

<p>With the spread of employment opportunities there was rush for getting employment in large number by persons unknown to employers. In such situation certificate was required to know the minimum ability of candidates. The examinations were started for this purpose. In beginning the schools used to certify the students but different schools followed different standards and lessons. Employers found difficulty in getting impression of the qualification and ability of candidate. The examination boards were constituted with responsibility of certification. It begun with establishment of examination boards on provincial level like United Provinces Board of High School and Intermediate Education in 1921, later Central Board of School Education was established. Now, examination for certification is being organised at Inter-national level also. All that it means is the needs of offices and industries was addressed by the education system. This crude education system got such a deeply rooted that in absence of few words on piece of a paper as certificate, a person was to be rejected for any ability.</p>

<p>For the reasons of formal ways in the production processes and offices the formalities crept in education and the subjects. The syllabus, subject contents in schools-colleges were determined and structured by considering the requirements from offices, industries and commercial establishments. When the education was informal, then also the syllabus was in appropriation with needs of trade and commerce and still it is true. Means, apart from learning the skills to earn, the education has never been seen as pure human needs. One difference is there that now it is not autonomously decided by education community but now state is deciding the subjects and syllabus to match needs of trade, commerce and industries. State has kidnapped the social control over education with the logic that the responsibility of educating all can be taken up by state only. It was an illusion.  The state has never been just on documented undertaking of ‘Education for all’. The fast changes in the needs of offices and industries and changes coming in socially controlled education was not possible at matching pace. So, it might delay the supply for the demand of workforce. Changes in curriculum or presenting new courses timely by the state was required to speed up the industrial development. At the same time the uniformity in the qualification is ensured by state level examinations enabling the employers to get the correct impression about ability of a candidate.</p>

<p>Hence, from the beginning of modern public schools in 19th century till 2008-09 there is continuous rise in number of schools, colleges and students studying there. The schools were opened in all villages, all clusters and all localities. In the localities lacking space, the teaching begun under the trees or in rented houses. During this period, government used to publish advertisement for purchasing land to open schools. Many schemes like scholarship, food, uniform, cycle etc. were started for orientating students towards education.  At college levels also these were done. Government did not open many colleges but colleges were opened at larger scale by private individuals and colleges running in rented houses too were recognised by government with a free hand. The same has been the case of technical institutions. Looking at the rising demand for technicians, the government and private bodies created crowd of technical institution. The industries were spreading, many types of banks, offices and commercial businesses started spanning their wings and these things made the state interested in spreading educational institutions as there was increasing need for educated manpower. The state behind the mask of welfare democratic institution served the interest of offices of governance and industries.</p>

<p>But with the beginning of 21st century there was a drastic change in the scenario, the industries and offices started substituting high numbers of manpower with intelligent machines. A software was capable of handling jobs of thousands of hands and brains. For example, the banks installed a machine in a smaller space for deposits, withdrawals and passbook printings as replacement of dealing clerks. The similar practice was adapted in other production centres and offices. Though mechanisation and digitalization raised the production and accuracy in products but at the same time workers in considerably large numbers were set aside from their work. Spending a large part of surplus on salaries of workers and labours and bearing their tantrums, the employers availed this opportunity as boon. The escape from discomfort over controlling workers and recurring costs on them was need of the surplus oriented business. This also provided tool for controlling costs to maintain profit in ever-increasing competitive market. In this way machines were erected to replace man. As net result there was no need of large number of manpower as it used to be in earlier time. Hence there was no need of educating the community at large.</p>

<p>In the beginning decade of this century the state was claiming its responsibility of providing easily accessible school to each child, schools opening movement was seen in each village, clusters and locality. The right to education as historically very important right was given to all children in first decade but in second decade the talks on school opening was stopped. Afterwards what to say of opening new schools, a new trend of closing existing schools started in the name of consolidation on grounds of land, buildings, number of students etc. Till 2010-12 there has been rise in the number of students in school but after 2012-13 there is decline in number of schools and students. Even with a high growth of private schools the number of students in schools is decreasing. Thousands of schools were closed in the country in name of consolidation. It is also planned to close colleges and Universities on basis of number of students and NAAC evaluation.</p>

<p>A new technology when roots up well in the industrial production and official sessions then there is reduction in demand for menial workers and consequently the number of schools is seen to be declining. It implies that the blind use of technology has not only decreased the employment opportunity but also deprived the opportunity of education. Now, the state as well as industrial community do not need manpower in large numbers. For this obvious reason the state is retreating herself from education.</p>

<p>Policies and laws follow changed context of time. Pace of change in policies and laws is not as fast as the pace of changes in its historical context. It takes a little time for the policies to adapt for the changes in situations. Education policy is also trying for appropriation to changed scenario. Recently in 2019 the new education policy is effort of appropriation to changes in industrial and official situations. Unlike earlier period, there is no need of large number of educated persons in offices and industries therefore new education policy gives emphasis on informal education, distant learning and digitization thus controlling the numbers of colleges.</p>

<p>It is the political economy of education! It means that in the context of changed economic behaviours appropriation in education is done by polity.
The education is passing through the phase of appropriation. Requirement of educated persons in Official and Industrial establishments can be matched only by educating 15 percent persons. This implies that the new education policy will not take up the responsibility of educating all. If it becomes compulsive necessity in the democratic setup to take the responsibility it will be paper work only but in practice state will not perform around this responsibility. Like in 2009 ‘Free and compulsory education to all’ granted on paper but the public education was forced to bow down in front of the private educational institutions and the public education became centre of taking catalytic advantages only. Now, policy wise new education policy 2020 is limiting the educational opportunities.</p>

<p>‘How to provide education to all with training skills’ is important responsibility of educationists in finding a disciplined way in this era of intelligent machines and artificial intelligence.</p>
